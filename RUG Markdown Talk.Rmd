# Introduction to R Markdown 
<br><br>
R Markdown is a file format type that allows you to create documents with imbedded R code and results. It is also a mark-up language, meaning it uses basic text plus symbols to create certain formatting elements that are implemented when the document is converted to its final form (ie. HTML document, PDF, Word Document). 
<br><br>
This will be a very brief overview of some main features of R Markdown, but there are *many* resources on the internet with much more detailed information, such as: [R Markdown: the Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#mathjax-equations) or [video tutorials from R Studio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).
<br><br>

## Rmd is good for making reports
<br><br>

* Decreases effort (compared to pasting results into new document)

* If data is updated or methods change, the tables or graphs are automatically updated

* Accessible for R users and non-users

     + Can hide or show code chunks
     
     + Comments and interpretation is rendered as separate text 
     
* Improved transparency and reproducibility  

* Formatting is built in

* Highly customizable!

## Example of code chunk with output
<br><br>

```{r}
summary(cars)
```
<br><br>

## How I use Rmd in my workflow
<br><br>
I assume that any code I write may need to be seen by other people, so I always just work directly in Rmd!
<br><br>

1. Each new analysis project gets its own R Project

2. Each sub-analysis gets its own self-contained Rmd document (ie. data exploration, multiple regression models, sensitivity analyses)

     i. Data is imported and cleaned
   
     ii. Analysis is performed with tables and figures generated along the way
   
     iii. Comments and interpretation are given
     
3. For manuscripts, I create a final Rmd document where all tables and figures for publication are together in one place with captions 

<br><br>
I will often make notes about methodology in these Rmd files so I can reference them later when I write my methods section. 
<br><br>

# Text formatting options
<br><br>
[R Studio's R Markdown Cheet sheet](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html) is a great reference for much of what is covered below. Cheet sheets are also available from the help tab in R Studio.
<br><br>
*Italics*: `*Italics*`
<br><br>
**Bold**: `**Bold**`
<br><br>

* Bullet list item: `* Bullet list item (note single space after asteriks)`
     - Sub-bullet: `     - Sub-bullet (five spaces before -, one space after -)`
     
$A^2 + B^2 = C^2$: `$A^2 + B^2 = C^2$`
<br><br>
$\beta$: `$\beta$`
<br>

<br><br>

# Output customization options

<br><br>
After you finish your Rmd document (or along the way), you will "knit" it into a completed product. A lot of the customization options for how the finished product will look are specified at the top of the Rmd file with arguments in the YAML header. 
<br><br>
Some helpful arguments:
<br><br>
`fontsize: 12pt`
<br><br>
`geometry: margin=1in`
<br><br>
Most other arguments are named as sub-arguments under `output:`
<br><br>
To render an HTML file:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
output: html_document
```

To specify options on the HTML file, such as adding a table of contents:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
output: 
  html_document:
    toc=TRUE 
```

Make the table of contents float as you scroll:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
output: 
  html_document:
    toc=TRUE 
    toc_float=TRUE
```
<br><br>
There are *many* more customization options, and HTML output has the most features and is the simplest to use. It is also possible to make slideshows with R Markdown, but I will not cover that here.

# Code chunk options

## Setup chunk

The setup chunk usually comes right after the YAML header and specifies the defaults for the chunks that follow. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Individual chunks

Code chunks can have their own individual specifications. Specify chunk options like this:

Do not print code chunk in final document:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
{r, echo=FALSE}
```

Do not run code chunk in final document:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
{r, eval=FALSE}
```

Do not print messages in final document:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
{r, message=FALSE}
```

Do not print warnings in final document: 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
{r, warning=FALSE}
```
<br><br>

# Create custom template 

**Step 1:** Create an R package. This is not as scary as it sounds!
<br><br>
First, make sure that you have the `devtools` package installed.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```
<br><br>
Now we can create the package.

1. File > "New Project"

2. New Directory > R Package

3. Name your package (I called mine `mypackage`)

<br><br>
**Step 2:** Create directory with proper folders
<br><br>
Create a directory with the properly named file paths. This step is very sensitive to file names, so only change the first part where the package name is specified!
<br><br>
Run in console:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
dir.create("mypackage/inst/rmarkdown/templates/report/skeleton", recursive = TRUE)
```
<br><br>
**Step 3:** Create your customized Rmd file!
<br><br>
Create a skeleton.Rmd file
<br><br>
File > New File > R Markdown
<br><br>
This is the document that will become your custom template. 
<br><br>

* Add render options in the YAML heading
* Add default chunk options in the setup chunk
* Load frequently used packages
* Any other text or formatting that you want on your template

<br><br>
When you are finished, save it as `skeleton.Rmd` in the `skeleton` folder that we just created.
<br><br>
**Step 4:** Make YAML file
<br><br>
File > New File > Text file
<br><br>
Type this in the document (Must include one line after the `name` line):
```{r,eval=FALSE}
name: My Report Template

```
<br><br>
Save this file as `template.yaml` in the `report` folder (one step up from the skeleton folder)
<br><br>
**Step 5:** Install your package!
<br><br>
```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install("mypackage")
```
<br><br>
You can test your template by trying to make a new R Markdown file and selecting the `From Template` option. You should see your template listed there.
<br><br>
If you want to make changes to your template, make sure to click the `Install and Restart` button in the Build tab (top right panel in R Studio) once you are finished.
<br><br>
